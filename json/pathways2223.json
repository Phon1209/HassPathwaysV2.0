How can critical thinking be used constructively? How can people learn from their past mistakes? How can social institutions and policies be set up to ensure that wise&#xA0;decisions are made to create a world that lasts into the extended future?",

Racial-ethnic formation is similarly used as an analytical tool for visualizing intersecting inequalities; history of science, medicine, arts, and technology.",
